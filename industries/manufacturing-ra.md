# Manufacturing digitization in hybrid cloud
{: #manufacturing}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-industry="Manufacturing"}
{: toc-use-case="ManufacturingIndustry"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

This reference architecture represents the generalization of practical experiences from hundreds of engagements around manufacturing digitization by IBM, Red Hat, and partners around the world. Based on hybrid cloud principles, it combines practices and lessons for the cloudification of the plants.

The 3-layered distributed reference architecture is the continuous representation of IBMâ€™s experience in applying technology and running IT projects in manufacturing environments with these key features:

   * Open
   * Standards-based
   * Modular
   * Replaceable
   * Brownfield
   * Plant-specific
   * Vendor-independent

You can use the reference architecture to identify your existing and needed functions for digitization in manufacturing. With that information along with the implementation examples, you can create a concrete solution architecture.

## Nonfunctional requirements
{: #nonfunctional-requirements}

Manufacturing architectures must satisfy several nonfunctional requirements.

* Performance:
   * Function offload to the edge. A centralized configuration is required with offload to the edge for rules-based decision making and streaming analytics.
   * Modular design. A microservices orientation allows for the modular design of IoT solutions.
   * Hybrid cloud. It must be possible to deploy the platform layer on premises, on the cloud, or partially on premises and partially on the cloud.
   * Unstructured and structured data. The system must handle structured data, including real-time messages and bulk transfer, and unstructured data, such as acoustic files, image files, recordings, and text documents.
   * User response time. The system must provide acceptable response times to users regardless of the volume of data that is being stored and the analytics that is happening in the background.
   * Real-time communications. Support is needed for bidirectional, real-time communications. This requirement is connected to the requirement for support of industrial or device protocols at the edge. Responses might need to happen in less than 1 second depending on the use case. This requirement also drives a need for edge-level analytics and decision making for that class of use cases.
   * Time series capture granularity. A timestamp at least to the millisecond is required so that even if that data is too late for real-time control, the catch-up analytics can see sequence of events.

* Scalability:
   * Horizontal scalability. The system must handle expanding load and data retention needs based on the upscaling of the solution scope, such as the addition of manufacturing facilities and buildings.

* Maintainability:
   * Adaptable and flexible. It must be possible to rapidly adapt the system to change the process, information, or participants that are being exchanged.
   * Maintainability and uptime. It must be possible to complete maintenance on the system without violating service level agreements for uptime. In a 24x7 environment, you must be able to do maintenance without completely taking down the system.

* Availability:
   * High availability. Some IoT solutions and domains demand highly available systems for 24x7 operations. This type of system isn't a critical production application, which means that operations or production don't stop if the IoT solution stops. You must confirm the actual expectation for the system.

* Security:
   * Device security. Devices must be able to register and communicate securely, such as by using TLS. Unauthorized devices are not allowed.
   * User security. User logon to any device must be secure and validated for their role. This requirement is connected to the LDAP or user registry that customers use.
   * Application security. Authorized users of the system that exchange information must be able to do so with the appropriate security controls.
   * Data security. All persisted data requires secure access.

* Volumetrics:
   * Big data. The system must be able to store and analyze volumes of data, both historical and current, on scales that are commonly known as *big data*.
   * Platform speed, capacity, and accessibility. The platform must support high volumes of data transmissions 24x7. This requirement includes support for remote locations and mobile data sources.

* Manageability:
   * Incident management. The system must include support for alerting, notification, and incident management.
   * Solution management. Support must exist for centralized solution management so that system support personnel can quickly determine the root cause of problems and fix them to avoid downtime.

* Usability:
   * Mobile support. Users must be able to interact in the same roles and on the same tasks on computers and mobile devices, where practical, given mobile capabilities.

## Components
{: #components}

The following represents a typical set of components that are deployed in a manufacturing solution.

| Architecture components | How the component is used |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Device| The device or programmable logic controller (PLC) is the representation and control of a physical entity or sensor that provides device information, which is accessible by using industrial protocols. Network integration for the device is part of the cyber portion of the device. The device is normally integrated by using operational technology (OT) protocols such as MODBUS/TCP, S7, and ProfiBUS/ProfiNET. The device can also be integrated by using IT protocols such as HTTP or MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT). However, those protocols are less common and valid for newer devices.|
| IoT gateway | The IoT or edge gateway, which is typically run on premises in a plant or warehouse, is responsible to connect supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, sensor gateways, and devices to the IoT platform. To do so, it receives device data by using device and industrial protocols, formats the data as needed, and uses an IT protocol to communicate with the platform. It might also filter and aggregate the data. Typically, it implements the Adaptor pattern and converts legacy manufacturing protocols, such as ProfiNet/ProfiBus, MODBUS, Open Platform Communications (OPC DA), and S7, into standard ones, such as Open Platform Communications United Architecture (OPC UA) and MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Other functions include aggregation, filtering, operational rules, and the deployment of trained analytical models. A subject of device management, it is recently based on container or serverless functions.|
| Plant gateway or plant service bus | The plant service bus implements the Service Bus pattern within the shop floor by providing routing, mediation, and transformation functions at the factory or plant level. The plant service bus takes over the integration logic from the plant application, machines, and devices by reducing the complexity of point-to-point connectivity. It is complementary to a manufacturing execution system (MES), enabling the separation of concern between manufacturing process implementation and pure integration. Based on this modularity, the plant service bus guarantees vendor-independence and an open standards-based implementation. In addition to the base integration function, an MQTT Message Hub provides a scalable implementation of an MQTT Topic Tree. The business-level flexibility and rule-based configuration is based on a rules-management system that is tightly integrated with the integration logic. That integration enables business-level behavior adjustment without IT dependency, dramatically reducing the implementation and test lifecycle. Comfortable rules-based management is combined with wire-speed performance and instant rules activation that are driven by the business. IT enables continuous operation by letting the business define manufacturing logic by using natural language-based rules definitions and validation. |
| Enterprise gateway or enterprise service bus | The enterprise gateway or enterprise service bus provides classical service bus functions for the decoupled integration of systems and machines, taking over integration logic, systems, and machines. It provides relief from integration-specific logic and enables the standardization of maintenance and release management. |
| Operator | An operator typically completes tasks such as equipment operation, setup, and operations support tasks. The operator interacts with device or operations-specific user interfaces on systems that integrate with the IoT solution by using collected IoT and operations data. |
| Sensor or actuator| A sensor provides a measurement that is meaningful for the physical entity, such as location, temperature, or humidity. It might or might not be physically attached to the physical entity. Actuators, such as valves, are also represented by this entity. |
| Production equipment tools | These tools are objects or machines that are of interest and subject to sensor measurements and actual behavior. These tools might be a robot, container, machine, furnace, or AGV.|
| SCADA| Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture that uses computers, networked data communications, and graphical user interfaces for high-level process supervisory management. SCADA uses other peripheral devices, such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) and discrete PID controllers to interface with the process plant or machinery. In this architecture, SCADA represents different things in different domains. For example, in the building management domain, SCADA represents a building management system or a low-level control system that controls processes in the building, such as a refrigerant. Less commonly, the SCADA system can also be integrated by using IT protocols such as HTTP or MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT).|
